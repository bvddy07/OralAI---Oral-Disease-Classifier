Got it 🚀 Let’s make a nice **README.md** for your project.
Since your project is an **Oral Disease Classifier using ResNet50**, I’ll keep it clean and professional 👇

# 🦷 OralAI — Oral Disease Classifier

OralAI is a deep learning project built with **PyTorch** that classifies oral diseases from images using a fine-tuned **ResNet50** model.  
The goal is to provide a tool that can automatically identify different oral conditions from patient images.
